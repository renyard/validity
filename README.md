## Introduction

Validity is a Google Chrome extension which allows for users to quickly validate their HTML documents from the address bar. This is intended to provide a simple and easy way for users to ensure that their HTML code is syntactically correct and performing as intended. 

## Getting Started

To get started, just add the extension to Chrome using this [link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/validity/bbicmjjbohdfglopkidebfccilipgeif?pli=1). 

## Features

In-Browser Validation: HTML code can be validated without leaving the browser by clicking the Validity icon in the address bar. 

Error Feedback: When the user validates the page using the icon in the address bar, the number and description of validation errors will be displayed in the JavaScript Console tab of Chrome's developer tools.

Installation Flexibility: Validity also gives users the option to use their own installation of the W3C Validation Service.  (For more information on installing the W3C Validation Service see the documentation at [http://validator.w3.org/docs/install.html](http://validator.w3.org/docs/install.html)).

## Credits
The Validator Team wishes to thank Nick Talbott and Stephen Yoch for their help in creating these installation instructions. Thanks also to all the people who use and review the guide to make it better and better!
